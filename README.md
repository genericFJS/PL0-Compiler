# PL0 compiler in C#
![.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/.Net_Framework-4.5.2-green) 

A compiler written in C# which compiles PL0-code to a binary format which can be read by a virtual machine (VM code kindly provided by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Arnold Beck).

The implementation is based on a solution in C. Therefore there are an unusual amount of arrays. Comments are written in German.
